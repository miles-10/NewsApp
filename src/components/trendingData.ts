        \n Requesting a special time in the House of Representatives meeting on Tuesday, the opposition lawmaker spoke on behalf of the party and said the government should answer the following questions.
        \n 1. Who will take the responsibility of deaths that the country witnessed during the lockdown because of hunger and lack of essential medical services? Likewise, who will take the responsibility of the deaths reported from quarantine camps?
        \n 2. How much money did the government spend in the Covid-19 response? For what purpose?
        \n 3. The quarantine camps are not well-managed and they have become a place to transmit infection. Are they quarantine camps or concentration camps set up to kill people?
        \n 4. Why did the government decide to narrow down the range of PCR tests?/n 5. Why is the government conducting RDT tests?
        \n5. Thapa demanded that either the prime minister or the chief of the high-level Covid-19 control committee (DPM Ishwar Pokharel) respond to his questions in the House. `,

        \n Writing an eight-page open letter to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli that he made public on his social media pages, Thapa said the government should completely restrict human movement except for emergency works in such places for at least two weeks.
        \n While shutting down everything for two weeks, the government should prepare infrastructures required for the treatment of the patients and leading people’s daily life back to normalcy, according to him.
        \n He suggested the government expand the range of PCR tests, improve contract tracing, focus on hospital-centric preparations, provide security and motivation to healthcare workers, manage repatriations of Nepali migrant workers stranded abroad, and ensure smooth availability of health workers, medicines, and medical equipment.`,

    discription: `\tNepali Congress spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma says the party does not believe that opposition parties have to resort to agitation and strikes.
        \n As the two ruling parties recently merged into one, Sharma clarified that his party would continue to be a ‘good opposition’ despite the challenge it faced with the unification.
        \n He argued that the unification between the two large communist forces would strengthen democracy, and that his party viewed the unification in the same light.
        \n “It is wrong to think that Nepali Congress lost just one election. Now, the Congress will commit itself to building its organisation after reviewing its defeat,” he added.
        \n Speaking at a press meet organised in Banke on Friday morning, Sharma said, “The opposition party must play creative and constructive roles. Throwing stones and holding strikes are not the mark of a character of a good opposition; Nepali Congress is a good opposition party.”\n Stating that NC would review the works after the incumbent government reaches its hundred days in office, he said that his party would raise alertness over weak and wrong steps and not stint in extending support on good works.`,

        \n Sharma now says Deuba was just suspecting if Oli agreed on the map. “This is just a suspicion of our president, not the party’s decision.” Therefore, instead of answering Deuba, the government and leaders of the ruling party should take initiatives to talk to India, he suggests.
        \n Speaking with journalists in Pokhara on Monday, Sharma also demanded that the government immediately publish a new map of Nepal clearly marking its borders with India and China. He added that the opposition party would do so if the government did not publish a new map on time.`,
