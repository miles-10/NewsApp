    discription: `\tThe Nepali Congress on Tuesday registered a constitution amendment bill of its own, the same one registered three years ago by the government led by party President Sher Bahadur Deuba. 
        \n The primary opposition registered the bill as per Saturday’s decision of its Central Working Committee, a day after two Madhes-based parties registered a joint private bill, seeking constitutional amendments. Eight lawmakers representing Madhes constituencies from the Congress, which has already backed a government-sponsored bill to amend the constitution to update the national emblem in accordance with the new political map, registered the bill at the parliament secretariat on Tuesday. 
        \n “This bill we have registered is a private bill, and it should receive support from the government,” said Nepali Congress lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh, who registered the bill. The bill, which had been shot down in July 2017 due to opposition from the then CPN-UML led by KP Sharma Oli, seeks to include all languages spoken in Nepal in the schedule of the constitution, accord equal citizenship rights to foreign women married to Nepali men and delineate electoral constituencies on the basis of population. `,
